# Capture targeting

## Current foreground content

Interpret “current page”, “what I am looking at”, or “this app” as the foreground window at request time:

```bash
ta capture frontmost --json
```

Do not open Ta, activate a different app, or list windows first unless disambiguation is required; those actions can change the meaning of “current”. Verify the returned `data.target.appName`, `bundleIdentifier`, title, and frame.

## Named app or exact window

When the user names an app or there are multiple windows:

1. Run `ta window list --app "<name-or-bundle-id>" --json`.
2. Compare app name, Bundle ID, title, frame, and z-order.
3. If one candidate unambiguously matches, call `ta capture window --window-id <id> --json`.
4. If several candidates remain plausible and their titles do not resolve the request, ask the user instead of guessing.

Window IDs are ephemeral. Re-list after `TARGET_NOT_FOUND` or `TARGET_CHANGED`; retry the capture at most once with the refreshed ID.

## Display or known region

List displays before referring to a non-default display. Use region capture only when coordinates are known from the task or a preceding result. Do not introduce an interactive selection overlay merely to discover coordinates.

## Silent-mode invariant

The ordinary capture methods are expected to:

- leave the foreground application unchanged;
- leave pointer position and keyboard focus unchanged;
- omit the cursor;
- avoid Ta windows and selection overlays.

If an operation requires visible UI—interactive selection, pinning, annotation, or a native-app scrolling capture—describe the impact and obtain the authorization appropriate to that visible action. Never simulate mouse or keyboard events through this skill.
